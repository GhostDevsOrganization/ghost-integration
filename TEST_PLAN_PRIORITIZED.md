# Smart Contract Protocol Testing Plan - Prioritized for the "Portal Concept"

## Goal

Build a comprehensive testing roadmap and test-suite for foundational protocols essential to establishing a Kaspa ecosystem connected via a "portal" (cross-chain bridge), with a focus on core utility like asset swapping and yield generation through "portal vaults."

## Prioritized Protocol Concepts

1.  **Cross-chain Bridge:** The core "Portal" mechanism for bringing external assets onto Kaspa.
2.  **Token Swapping (DEX):** Enables trading and liquidity for assets arriving via the portal.
3.  **Lending & Staking Vaults:** Provides utility for assets by enabling yield generation through lending and staking (the "Portal Vaults" concept).
4.  **Oracle Network:** Provides essential external data feeds (like prices) required by financial protocols.
5.  **Multi-signature Wallet:** Provides secure asset management capabilities for protocol treasuries, multi-user accounts, etc.
6.  **Yield Optimization Vaults:** Builds upon basic lending/staking to automate strategies for maximizing returns (an advanced form of "Portal Vaults").

| Lending & Staking Vaults | 4                | High     | Core utility for yield generation ("Portal Vaults"). Depends on Oracle. |
| Yield Optimization Vaults| 5                | Medium   | Layered complexity, depends on Lending/Staking and DEX.               |
| Cross-chain Bridge       | 5                | Highest  | Core "Portal" mechanism, highest complexity due to cross-chain coordination. |

#### Logical Order (for Testing)

1.  **Oracle Network:** Test data fetching interfaces and reliability.
2.  **Multi-signature Wallet:** Test basic transaction submission, confirmation, and execution.
3.  **Token Swapping (DEX):** Test core swap and liquidity functions.
4.  **Lending & Staking Vaults:** Test supply, withdraw, borrow, repay, and liquidation flows. Requires Oracle dependency.
5.  **Yield Optimization Vaults:** Test deposit, withdraw, and reward claiming, ensuring interaction with underlying protocols works. Depends on Lending/Staking and DEX.
6.  **Cross-chain Bridge:** Test lock/mint and burn/release flows, including relaying and proof verification. Highest complexity, often tested last or in parallel with mocks.
